# Start with virtual box

To play with linux virtual machine, you can choose to use VMplayer or VirtualBox or HyperV on win10.
VirtualBox from Oracle has a better licence.

You can change VirtualBox [language](http://ccm.net/faq/40865-virtualbox-how-to-change-the-language-settings)


You can download your Linux image and verify the download [checksum](https://www.lifewire.com/validate-md5-checksum-file-4037391), make sure that your download is perfect.
```
certutil -hashfile bodhi-4.1.0-64.iso MD5 
```
output should be the same as your MD5 file, if the values don't match then the file is not valid and you should download it again.

# CoreOS linux inside VirtualBox
CoreOS is widely used for Docker, kubernetes and cloud based VMs. So it's time to see how to create CoreOS linux with VirtualBox.  
If your host OS is linux as well, then you can follow official guide https://coreos.com/os/docs/latest/booting-on-virtualbox.html

In my case host OS is win10, so I follow https://deis.com/blog/2015/coreos-on-virtualbox/ and https://gist.github.com/noonat/9fc170ea0c6ddea69c58 do all steps manually.  
A tutorial with screenshots https://linoxide.com/distros/install-coreos-virtualbox-iso/  
Two tutorial with video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiWa0KFJDfI and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBXcWsGY540   

Several important things to know:   
memery should provide at least 2G, otherwise you will have kernel panic, out of memory errors when start up iso.  
![storage settings must be carefull:]({{ site.url }}/images/VirtualBoxStorage.png)

once CoreOS start, by default it login as user core without password. Then you start to cloud_config.yml to create users, ssh keys...
https://coreos.com/os/docs/latest/cloud-config.html    
This file is saved /home/core by run `cat > cloud_config.yml <contents...>`, ctl+z quit the edit. Inside the contents, you can't not move left,right,up and down, so type carefully. You could try install nano etc follow https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/203606/is-there-any-way-to-install-nano-on-coreos but not tested
1. Boot up the CoreOS box and connect as the core user   
2. Run the /bin/toolbox command to enter the stock Fedora container.    
3. Install any software you need. To install nano in this case, it would be as simple as doing a dnf -y install nano (dnf has replaced yum)    
4. Use nano to edit files. "But wait -- I'm in a container!" Don't worry -- the host's file system is mounted at /media/root when inside the container. So just save a sample file at /media/root/home/core/cloud-config.yml, then exit the container, and finally go list the files in /home/core. Notice your cloud-config.yml file?    

Or you can setup FTP server on host win10 https://youtu.be/Cd2k9nQSdro, then upload cloud_config.yml there and download to CoreOS via 
https://superuser.com/questions/265062/downloading-file-from-ftp-using-curl
```
curl -u 'user:password' 'ftp://mysite/%2fusers/myfolder/myfile/raw' -o ~/cloud-config.yml
```

ssh rsa public key, you can generate from git bash as instructed by https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/
just keep press enter to ignore password for your private key, then paste the generated public key to below file. If you have generated ssh before, just use them    

```
#!
#cloud-config
users:
- name: nitish
  # passwd are hashed and generated by    sudo openssl passwd -1
  # passwd generation on Linux do not do it on win10
  passwd: $1$yxV9YDKT$s.fAj5dlFyrPwrH0xAQJy/
  groups:
    - sudo
    - docker
  ssh_authorized_keys:
    - "ssh_rsa AAAAB3NzaC1...snip"
```
Valide this cloud-config.yml in website https://coreos.com/validate/

Reboot and install CoreOS into the harddisk /dev/sda  https://coreos.com/os/docs/latest/installing-to-disk.html    
```
sudo coreos-install -d /dev/sda -C stable -c ~/cloud-config.yml
```
Run `sudo fdisk -l`. You should have a /dev/sda device. 

Then you can poweroff `sudo shutdown -h now` and unmount ISO in CD and continu further test.   

Connecting the CoreOS with ssh, you need config ![port forwarding]({{ site.url }}/images/VirtualBoxPortForwarding.png)
open a cmd in your Host win10
```
>> ssh -p 22022 core@127.0.0.1
Last login: Thu Apr 23 15:50:31 2015 from 192.168.59.3

# https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/force-ssh-client-to-use-given-private-key-identity-file/
>> ssh -p 2222 -i 'c:\user\ydd9\.ssh\id_rsa' core@ip
```

# SSH explained   
https://wiki.debian.org/SSH    
In addition this directory contains the private/public key pairs identifying your host :   

ssh_host_dsa_key   
ssh_host_dsa_key.pub    
ssh_host_rsa_key   
ssh_host_rsa_key.pub   

Since OpenSSH 5.73, a new private/public key pair is available:    
  
ssh_host_ecdsa_key   
ssh_host_ecdsa_key.pub    

Since OpenSSH 6.54, a new private/public key pair is available:   

ssh_host_ed25519_key   
ssh_host_ed25519_key.pub   

check ssh server    
https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-install-start-and-connect-to-ssh-server-on-fedora-linux   
```
$ systemctl start sshd
$ netstat -ant | grep 22
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:22              0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN 
tcp6       0      0 :::22                   :::*                    LISTEN
```

if ssh core@ip always asks password https://www.digitalocean.com/community/questions/coreos-ssh-asks-for-password  
always doesn't connnect, you will see problem and a cloud-config.yaml https://github.com/coreos/bugs/issues/791:   
Make sure that your keys are present in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys and try running your SSH client in verbose mode. 
```
ssh -p 2222 -A -v -i 'c:\user\ydd9\.ssh\id_rsa' core@10.255.100.167
```

# CoreOS add user   
https://coreos.com/os/docs/latest/adding-users.html   be carefull about the Container Linux Config file you see, its format is not the same as cloud-config.yml  
1. add user when create the VM  

2. add user by command  
The "*" creates a user that cannot login with a password but can log in via SSH key. -U creates a group for the user, -G adds the user to the existing sudo group and -m creates a home directory. If you'd like to add a password for the user, run:
```
$ sudo useradd -p "*" -U -m user1 -G sudo

$ sudo passwd user1
New password:
Re-enter new password:
passwd: password changed.
```

# Debian OS
http://www.brianlinkletter.com/installing-debian-linux-in-a-virtualbox-virtual-machine/  
Debian OS full CD ISO(not the small version netinst) is very easy to install with graphical user interface.  

During installation steps, it always failed to install standard system utilities, but it seems not a big issue for a functional Debian, just not convenient to use if some moduels you will need later.  
https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/307600/whats-the-consequences-if-i-dont-install-the-standard-system-utilities-of-de

Fix the apt-get install error: “Media change: please insert the disc labeled ...” on your Linux VPS   
https://www.velocihost.net/clients/knowledgebase/29/Fix-the-apt-get-install-error-Media-change-please-insert-the-disc-labeled--on-your-Linux-VPS.html   
```
Media change: please insert the disc labeled
 'Debian GNU/Linux 7.0.0 _Wheezy_ - Official amd64 CD Binary-1 20130504-14:44'
in the drive '/media/cdrom/' and press enter

$ nano /etc/apt/sources.list 
or
$ vi /etc/apt/sources.list

You might find a 
deb cdrom:[Debian GNU/Linux 7.0.0 _Wheezy_ - Official amd64 CD Binary-1 20130504-14:44]/ wheezy main 
line indicating a local CDROM as a package source. 

Comment it out by placing a # symbol at the beginning of the line and save the file.
Or place cursor at the beginning of the line and type dd to delete the line, :wq save and quit vi editor.
```

To update the sources.list and config it as your own Debian distribution, here mine is stretch https://wiki.debian.org/SourcesList  
PS: Wheezy, jessie, stretch are different debian distributions, be consistent everywhere with your case!!!   
Example sources.list for Debian stretch
```
deb  http://deb.debian.org/debian stretch main contrib non-free
deb-src  http://deb.debian.org/debian stretch main contrib non-free

deb  http://deb.debian.org/debian stretch-updates main contrib non-free
deb-src  http://deb.debian.org/debian stretch-updates main contrib non-free

deb http://security.debian.org/ stretch/updates main contrib non-free
deb-src http://security.debian.org/ stretch/updates main contrib non-free
```

Then you can update Debian stretch
```
apt-get update
apt update
```

### remote connection in case of NAT(default network settings in VirtualBox)
Now install ssh in Debian
```
root@Debian: $ apt-get install openssh-server
# just for convevience
root@Debian: $ apt-get install sudo
```
Then open CMD on your host win10 and login as a no root
```
# ssh -p 2222 node1@127.0.0.1
node1 password: 
```

### remote connection in case of host-only network(switch first in VirtualBox when config multi nodes kubernetes cluster)
```
# reboot and login as root
# append desired IP hostanme in config file /etc/hosts
192.168.99.20   kubemaster.test.com kubemaster
192.168.99.21   kubeslave1.test.com kubeslave1

# assign this host a name
$ hostnamectl set-hostname kubemaster
$ ip a
...

    link/ether 08:00:27:f0:e9:6d brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 192.168.99.100/24 brd 192.168.99.255 scope global dynamic enp0s3
       valid_lft 1119sec preferred_lft 1119sec
    inet6 fe80::a00:27ff:fef0:e96d/64 scope link
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
...
```
To connect it remotely from host
```
# ssh user@192.168.99.100
```


To enable root login with password https://linuxconfig.org/enable-ssh-root-login-on-debian-linux-server  
you need to first configure SSH server. Open /etc/ssh/sshd_config and add the following line
under `# PermitRootLogin prohibit-password`  
```
PermitRootLogin yes
```
Once you made the above change restart your SSH server:
```
$ /etc/init.d/ssh restart
[ ok ] Restarting ssh (via systemctl): ssh.service.

$ or try systemctl
systemctl restart sshd.service
```

config SSH key password: two ways
ONE WAY,   
copy your public key to a remote host with the command ssh-copy-id
```
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub $remote_user@$remote_host
```
This allows connection for remote_user only, if you have root(not good practice) and other users, repeat the command.


ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub $remote_user@$remote_host
If you want to connect with paired key/password to mitigate middle man attack risk, https://www.debian.org/devel/passwordlessssh you need to generate key/pass `id_rsa.pub`/ `id_rsa` on Debian/win10 by `ssh-keygen -t rsa` and find them under `~/.ssh/id_rsa` in Debian, `C:\Users\ydd9\.ssh` in win10. Next, add the contents of the public key file into the file ~/.ssh/authorized_keys on the remote site (the file should be mode 600) for each users you would like to use.   
Note that once you've set this up, if an intruder breaks into your account/site, they are given access to the site you are allowed in without a password, too! For this reason, this should never be done from root.   

Below steps will force all users can't access with password, use with caution.
Even after config SSH KEY PASS, it still asks pass, then check https://askubuntu.com/questions/346857/how-do-i-force-ssh-to-only-allow-uses-with-a-key-to-log-in to config sshd_config and set `PasswordAuthentication no` then restart sshd.service     

In win10 if connection doesn't work, try the key/pass generated from linux and check the 'C:\Users\ydd9\.ssh\know_host' file if there's duplications entries


install Virtualbox in Debian stretch, command `sudo apt-get install virtualbox` won't work as https://wiki.debian.org/VirtualBox explains, you must do following ofr virtualbox 5.1
```
# Add virtualbox.list to /etc/apt/sources.list.d
deb http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/debian stretch contrib

# Add Oracle VirtualBox public key:
wget https://www.virtualbox.org/download/oracle_vbox_2016.asc
sudo apt-key add oracle_vbox_2016.asc

# Install virtualbox-5.1
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install virtualbox-5.1
```

If you go for latest version, carefully choose virtualbox.deb installer for your Debian stretch. Download manually or via wget. You can install it using sudo apt install /path/to/package/name.deb. Normally it install dependencies as well, if not do installation in two steps:
```
dpkg -i /path/to/pakcage/virtualbox-5.2_5.2.4-119785~Debian~stretch_amd64.deb
# -f fix the dependencies
apt-get -f install
```

Once you run virtualbox `/sbin/vboxconfig` to check installation, you will be asked to have a correct version of header as said below link, you can `apt-get install linux-headers-4.9.0-4-amd64`, always be concious about the versions.
https://askubuntu.com/questions/873374/virtualbox-on-ubuntu-16-04-lts-system-is-not-currently-set-up-to-build-kernel
```
error  
Please install the gcc make perl packages from your distribution.
Please install the Linux kernel "header" files matching the current kernel
```

https://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=82317    

package conflicts is not good to search and install one by one, because you will face issues like avalanche.   
NOT A GOOD PRATICE IN MY POINT OF VIEW   
When you really have package conflicts issues, you can google debian packages <conflict package>,  
then downloads them and install one by one with dpkg -i <path of deb>     

Nested Virtualization  
If you see error in your Guest OS Debian an error like   
```
This computer doesn't have VT-X/AMD-v enabled. Enabling it in the BIOS is mandatory
```

You mostly have activate VT-x/AMD-v in your virtualbox settings, but it does not work, most because similar issue https://github.com/docker/machine/issues/4271 and http://wiki.osdev.org/VirtualBox
