# [Bitwise Operators](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/bitwise_operators_example.htm)
	
& 
Binary AND Operator: copies a bit to the result if it exists in both operands	(a & b) 

| 
Binary OR	Operator: It copies a bit if it exists in either operand.	(a | b) 

^ 
Binary XOR Operator: It copies the bit if it is set in one operand but not both.	(a ^ b)

~ 
Binary Ones Complement Operator: It is unary and has the effect of 'flipping' bits.	(~a )

<< 
Binary Left Shift Operator: The left operands value is moved left by the number of bits specified by the right operand.	a << 2

>> 
Binary Right Shift Operator: The left operands value is moved right by the number of bits specified by the right operand.
