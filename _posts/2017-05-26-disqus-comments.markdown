It's cool function to have reader comments on your posts in github. So I decided to have this function from disqus in my page as well. I searched on the tutorial about how to add but actually they're all out dated, new way to setup is much easier.

First I need to register a disqus account and then follow get started section to add my github url into disqus and complete the 2 steps setup.
