# [volumes](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#volumes)</br>
Mount host paths or named volumes, specified as sub-options to a service.

You can mount a host path as part of a definition for a single service, and there is no need to define it in the top level volumes key.

But, if you want to reuse a volume across multiple services, then define a named volume in the top-level volumes key. Use named volumes with services, swarms, and stack files.

Note: The top-level volumes key defines a named volume and references it from each service’s volumes list. This replaces volumes_from in earlier versions of the Compose file format. See Use volumes and Volume Plugins for general information on volumes.

This example shows a named volume (mydata) being used by the web service, and a bind mount defined for a single service (first path under db service volumes). The db service also uses a named volume called dbdata (second path under db service volumes), but defines it using the old string format for mounting a named volume. Named volumes must be listed under the top-level volumes key, as shown.

version: "3.2"
services:
  web:
    image: nginx:alpine
    volumes:
      - type: volume
        source: mydata
        target: /data
        volume:
          nocopy: true
      - type: bind
        source: ./static
        target: /opt/app/static

  db:
    image: postgres:latest
    volumes:
      - "/var/run/postgres/postgres.sock:/var/run/postgres/postgres.sock"
      - "dbdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data"

volumes:
  mydata:
  dbdata:
```
Note: See Use volumes and Volume Plugins for general information on volumes.</br>
Syntax: volumes is simply a string, don't put space after column, simply `- "/var/run/postgres/postgres.sock:/var/run/postgres/postgres.sock"`
or `- "dbdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data"`

# [Choose between named volumes, mount volues and volume as a container](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36312699/chown-docker-volumes-on-host-possibly-through-docker-compose/36321403#36321403)

It's best to not try to access files inside /var/lib/docker directly where named volumes stored. Those directories are meant to be managed by the docker daemon, and not to be messed with.

To access the data inside a volume, there's a number of options;

* use a bind-mounted directory (you considered that, but didn't fit your use case).</br>
* use a "service" container that uses the same volume and makes it accessible through that container, for example a container running ssh (to use scp) or a SAMBA container (such as svendowideit/samba)</br>
* use a volume-driver plugin. there's various plugins around that offer all kind of options. For example, the local persist plugin is a really simple plug-in that allows you to specify where docker should store the volume data (so outside of /var/lib/docker)</br>

# env
environment<br/>
Add environment variables. You can use either an array or a dictionary. Any boolean values; true, false, yes no, need to be enclosed in quotes to ensure they are not converted to True or False by the YML parser.<br/>
Environment variables with only a key are resolved to their values on the machine Compose is running on, which can be helpful for secret or host-specific values.<br/>
```
environment:
  RACK_ENV: development
  SHOW: 'true'
  SESSION_SECRET:
environment:
  - RACK_ENV=development
  - SHOW=true
  - SESSION_SECRET
```
Note: If your service specifies a build option, variables defined in environment are not automatically visible during the build. Use the args sub-option of build to define build-time environment variables.<br/>

From <https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#environment> 

Setting Variables in Dockerfiles<br/>
So, how do you set stuff so it’s available to future running containers? ENV. Take a look at this Dockerfile snippet:
```
(Dockerfile snippet)
ENV foo /bar     # or ENV foo=/bar
ADD . $foo       # or ADD . ${foo}
# which translates to: ADD . /bar
```
or declare env as below
```
(Dockerfile snippet)
ARG some_variable_name
ENV env_var_name=$some_variable_name

ARG DB_APP=postgres_app
ENV DB_APP=$DB_HOST
```

Passing Environment Variables From the Host Into a Container(overwrite ???)<br/>
Unless, you don’t specify the value of the environmant variable in the command line, but just the name:
```
$ docker run -e env_var_name alpine env
```

or pass new env for this container via docker-compose
```
(docker-compose file snippet)
version : '3.2'
services:
  app:
    image: "app"
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      - 'DB_APP=postgres://postgres:password@10.0.2.15:5432/app'
```

ARGS
https://vsupalov.com/docker-env-vars/<br/>
Add build arguments, which are environment variables accessible only during the build process.<br/>
First, specify the arguments in your Dockerfile:
```
ARG buildno
ARG password
RUN echo "Build number: $buildno"
RUN script-requiring-password.sh "$password"
$ docker build --build-arg some_variable_name=a_value
```
From <https://vsupalov.com/docker-env-vars/> 


Then specify the arguments under the build key. You can pass either a mapping or a list:
```
build:
  context: .
  args:
    buildno: 1
    password: secret
build:
  context: .
  args:
    - buildno=1
    - password=secret
You can omit the value when specifying a build argument, in which case its value at build time is the value in the environment where Compose is running.
args:
  - buildno
  - password
```
Note: YAML boolean values (true, false, yes, no, on, off) must be enclosed in quotes, so that the parser interprets them as strings.

Save and load images following commands were executed:
```
docker save --output latestversion-1.0.0.tar dockerregistry/latestversion:1.0.0
copy the image to a server, and import is as follows:
docker load --input latestversion-1.0.0.tar
```
